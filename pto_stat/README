Before run test, you must ensure the dependent libs install in your machine.
libs:
1. ports/jsoncpp-0.5.0-4
2. ports/jsoncpp-devel-0.5.0-4
3. google protobuf last stable

After install that, you can run some command as follow:
1. make
2. sh run_test_speed.sh

Then will generate a log --> result.log at current folder, that's all & have fun :)
